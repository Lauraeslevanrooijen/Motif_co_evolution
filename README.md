# Supplementary Materials for Project: Exploring the Role of Protein Motif Co-evolution in Genome Evolution: An Elusive Phenomenon

## Overview
This repository contains supplementary materials for the research project titled "UExploring the Role of Protein Motif Co-evolution in Genome Evolution: An Elusive Phenomenon" The project aims to investigate the occurrence and impact of protein motif co-evolution on the evolution of eukaryotic genomes.

## Abstract
The gene content of modern eukaryotic genomes has been shaped by evolutionary processes over millions of years. These processes do not result in random patterns of gene content of genomes. One such process is that proteins that co-evolve tend to be part of the same pathway or belong to the same protein complex. However, not all proteins in the same process co-evolve. In some cases, no co-evolution at the protein level is observed, and instead, co-evolution can occur at the level of interaction motifs between proteins. In these cases, a motif in protein A co-evolves with the interaction partner protein B, showing there is still a level of co-evolution between the proteins. However, there are only four known cases of protein motif co-evolution; hence, there is limited knowledge about protein motif co-evolution and its impact on genome evolution. To better understand this factor that potentially impacts genome evolution, we conducted a large-scale investigation to discover potential cases of protein motif co-evolution that could be compared to examples from the literature. This analysis revealed that protein motif co-evolution is a relatively elusive phenomenon and does not act as a strong driver of genome evolution. However, part of the lack of impact is difficulty detecting protein motif co-evolution due to technical and conceptual challenges and limitations, such as identifying orthologous groups and determining whether identified motifs are involved in protein interactions.
